## PM Autoworks

This is a front-end project for a an automotive repairshop located in San Jose.

## Motivation

The purpose of this app was to get myself familiarized with building a front-end web app and integrate third party APIs where it is appropriate.

The end goal is to have an improved website that PM Autoworks can use compared to their existing website. An improved website will improve foot traffic to their shop.

### Learning Points

This project brought me out of Bootstrap 4's comfort zone as I had to learn customized CSS to achieve certain visual goals. Some of these items include using keyframes, media queries, overlays, and resizing images.

I used third party APIs provided by Yelp and Google to collect information related to the business and display it. This required me to carefully read through their documenation. However, I realized that documentations may not be 100% step-by-step as I found out about the Google Maps JavaScript API. Since my app is built on React, I had to find out how to load a script that takes in an API key and use a callback function.

I also used several libraries to help me when needed. This was quite a learning experience as I quickly realized that not all libraries are equal. Some libraries are well documented and maintained while others have halfway completed documentation requiring me to fill in the gaps.
